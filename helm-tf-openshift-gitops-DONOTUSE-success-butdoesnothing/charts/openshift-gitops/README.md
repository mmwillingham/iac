# Install and configure an Argo CD instance

Install and patch an Argo CD instance, for example when you would like to initialize OpenShift-GitOps for the first time, or would like to deploy another instance fo application deployments. 

It is best used with a GitOps approach such as Argo CD does. For example, https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-cluster-bootstrap

## TL;DR 

```console
helm repo add --force-update tjungbauer https://charts.stderr.at
helm repo update
```

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.12+
* Helm 3

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release tjungbauer/openshift-gitops
```

The command deploys the chart on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
